# CycleSage

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

CycleSage is a project to help people who menstruate in order to give more insights about their cycle. To understand individual characteristics, symptoms, possible alarms and guidance through the whole cycle. The system/app/service will gather data from people who menstruate in all kinds of contexts, analize also medical data and public health records in order to learn and give accurate results to each individual.


## Background

Menstruation has always been a tabu topic in many contexts, we lack of research and information in this topic and this contributes to the lack of support for people who menstruate. This project will help to gather data which will provide knowledge in other areas and also will help to give valid information to people who need it in their day-to-day life. This in the future will contribute to an improvement in the health and quality of life. 

Current problems in the area:
* Lack of data about the topic.
* Insufficiency of research.
* Availability of information for people who menstruate.


## How is it used?

* People who menstruate will have access to the system, where their collected parameters and characteristics will act as input for the system which will offer guidance through their cycle, including alerts, tips, reminders, predictions and more. 
* The system will also be used in research in order to amplify solutions and adapt diagnoses and protocols to people who menstruate.
* The system will need to be used by people in all kinds of contexts but also people in health related fields in order to contribute in all aspects. 

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
The data will be collected from public health records and records with consent for research. Also people who are willing to contribute will be in the development process. Data can be collected via volunteers and data that is already public. 

## Challenges

The lack of information about this topics is a limitation during the whole process. Also the access to records like this that are delicate and sometimes private will be a challenge. 
As every AI realted to health issues, the ethical questions will bring up challenges, and in reality we don't have a lot of regulations or procedures clear for using this type of technology. Regulatory issues and norms will be one of the hardest challenges to bring the project to the public.

## What next?

We will need suport of experts, in the area of health, technology and ethics. As well as input from external sources who give the actual importance to the project. People and institutions willing to found and suport the project in a long term.
